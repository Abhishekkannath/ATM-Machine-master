This project is a implementation of an ATM machine in Java. It includes the following functionalities:

2. Account Information: The ATM displays the user's account information, such as their account balance and transaction history.

3. Withdrawal: Users can withdraw cash from their account. The amount is deducted from their account balance.

4. Deposit: Users can deposit cash into their account. The amount is added to their account balance.

5. Transfer: Users can transfer funds from their account to another account. The amount is deducted from their account balance and added to the recipient's account.

6. Change PIN: Users can change their password.

To use the ATM machine, simply run the ATM.java file and follow the on-screen instructions. This project can be expanded upon to include additional functionalities and security features, such as transaction limits and card lockout.
